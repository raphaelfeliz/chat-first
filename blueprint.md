- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the application's structure, styles, and scripts.
- `.idx/mcp.json`: Configuration file for the Firebase development environment.

## Features

- **Split-screen layout:**
    - Left side: Displays a list of products with images and prices.
    - Right side: A real-time chat interface.
